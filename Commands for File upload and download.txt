Upload a file → ThinkPad

From arch-predator (client):

scp file.txt arjun@thinkpad:/home/arjun/


Upload a directory:

scp -r myfolder arjun@thinkpad:/srv/data/

Download a file ← ThinkPad
scp arjun@thinkpad:/srv/data/file.txt .


Download a directory:

scp -r arjun@thinkpad:/srv/data/project .


Method 2: Rsync (Best for large data & backups)

This is the correct tool when:

Files are large

Transfers are repeated

You want resume + progress

Upload with progress
rsync -avh --progress myfolder/ arjun@thinkpad:/srv/data/myfolder/

Download with progress
rsync -avh --progress arjun@thinkpad:/srv/data/myfolder/ ./myfolder/


Method 3: Samba (Windows-style shared folder)

You already set this up.

On Linux
ls /mnt
sudo mount -t cifs //thinkpad/share /mnt/share -o username=arjun


Or browse via file manager:

smb://thinkpad

On Windows / Android

Open file manager

Use:

\\thinkpad


Login with Samba credentials

Good for:

Drag & drop

Media access
