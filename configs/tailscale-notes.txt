### 5️⃣ `configs/tailscale-notes.txt`

```text
Tailscale Notes

Purpose:
- Emergency remote SSH
- Optional subnet routing

Not part of core stack.
Must never block boot.
Must be removable without breakage.

When enabled:
- SSH only
- No exit node
- LAN still primary
```

This prevents **future-you** from overengineering it.
