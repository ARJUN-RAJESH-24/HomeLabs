# Day 2 Log — OS Hardening & Storage Foundation
Date: 2026-01-11  
Node: Lenovo ThinkPad E530c (Primary Server)  
OS: Linux Mint (Ubuntu 24.04 base)  
Kernel: Liquorix (transition planned)

---

## Objectives
- Harden base OS without breaking access
- Secure and verify SSH
- Reduce unnecessary background services
- Enforce server-like power behavior
- Configure persistent, scalable storage
- Prepare system for future expansion

---

## Firewall
- Installed and enabled UFW
- Set default policy: deny incoming, allow outgoing
- Explicitly allowed SSH
- Verified SSH connectivity from Acer Predator after firewall enable

Status: ✅ Active and verified

---

## SSH
- OpenSSH server installed and enabled at boot
- SSH access verified over LAN (Predator → ThinkPad)
- Key-based authentication tested successfully
- Root login over SSH disabled
- Password authentication retained temporarily for recovery safety

Status: ✅ Stable and secure

---

## Service Hygiene
- Reviewed all running services
- Disabled non-server services:
  - Avahi (mDNS)
  - CUPS / cups-browsed (printing)
- Retained intentionally:
  - Bluetooth (keyboard input)
  - Touchégg (touchpad gestures)
  - LightDM and GUI services (until final headless transition)
- Verified SSH and networking remained functional after changes

Status: ✅ Reduced attack surface with intentional exceptions

---

## Power & Behavior
- Disabled sleep, suspend, hibernate, and hybrid-sleep targets
- Configured systemd-logind to ignore all lid-close events
- Enforced low screen brightness via systemd service for power saving
- Verified system remains reachable over SSH during lid close/open
- Observed minor SSH input lag during lid close/open due to active GUI stack; accepted as expected behavior until final headless transition

Status: ✅ Predictable, always-on behavior (within GUI constraints)

---

## Storage
- Verified data disk (/dev/sdb1) health via SMART (PASSED)
- Confirmed existing ext4 filesystem and UUID
- Mounted data disk at /srv/data
- Configured persistent mount via /etc/fstab using UUID
- Verified mount persistence using mount -a
- Initialized directory structure:
  - /srv/data/media
  - /srv/data/family
  - /srv/data/uploads
  - /srv/data/backups
- Verified automatic mount and availability
- Confirmed active swapfile (12 GB)

Status: ✅ Persistent, production-ready storage foundation

---

## Storage – Future Expansion
- Storage mounts use UUIDs for stability
- One mount point per disk under /srv/
- Design allows additional disks to be added without impacting existing services

---

## System State Summary
- Firewall active and enforced
- SSH secure and reliable
- No unnecessary services running
- Power behavior disciplined
- Persistent data storage configured
- Swap active and healthy
- System stable under reboot and remote access

---

## Notes
- Liquorix kernel retained for now; generic/LTS kernel installed in parallel
- Kernel transition and GUI removal planned for later phase
