## System
**Primary Server:** Lenovo ThinkPad E530c  
**OS:** Linux Mint (Ubuntu Noble base)  
**Kernel:** Liquorix (temporary)  
**Role:** Primary Home Server (in setup phase)

---

## Hardware & Firmware

- Laptop hardware refurbished and repurposed for server use
- Thermal paste reapplied approximately one week prior
- Verified thermal stability using CPU-X (fast run) and `lm-sensors`
- Intel `coretemp` driver detected and active
- CPU temperatures observed within safe operating range (no alarms)
- Fan RPM not exposed (EC-controlled), expected ThinkPad behavior
- Discrete NVIDIA GPU disabled in BIOS to reduce power consumption and thermal load
- Wake-on-LAN enabled in BIOS (pending validation on built-in Ethernet)
- Intel VT-x (CPU virtualization) enabled in BIOS for future extensibility
- Dead battery; system operates exclusively on AC power

---

## Operating System

- System fully updated (`apt update && apt upgrade`)
- Liquorix kernel identified as non-ideal for long-term server stability
- Decision made to migrate to a generic / LTS kernel in a later phase
- GUI retained temporarily for observability during initial bring-up

---

## Power Management

- System sleep, suspend, hibernate, and hybrid-sleep targets masked via systemd
- Laptop lid close behavior configured to `ignore` on AC power
- Display backlight device (`intel_backlight`) detected
- Plan established to force minimum brightness to reduce idle power draw

---

## Networking

- Network interfaces enumerated and verified
- Active network connectivity currently via USB Ethernet adapter (`enx*`)
- Built-in Ethernet interface (`enp12s0`) currently not connected
- LAN IP assignment and routing confirmed
- Internet reachability verified via active interface
- Wake-on-LAN capability pending validation on built-in Ethernet NIC (USB NIC may not support WoL)

---

## Services

- OpenSSH server installed
- SSH service enabled to start automatically on boot
- SSH verified as active and running
- Remote administrative access confirmed

---

## Storage

- Disk visibility verified using `lsblk`
- Internal SSD (128 GB) hosting OS
- Internal HDD (≈465 GB) detected and available for future data use
- SMART health checks performed on both disks
- SMART overall-health self-assessment: **PASSED** on all drives

---

## Constraints & Notes

- Laptop platform with EC-controlled fan limits telemetry
- No UPS available
- Intermittent internet connectivity expected
- Remote administration anticipated (300–500 km distance)
- Wake-on-LAN testing requires wired connection to built-in Ethernet

---

## Status

**Day 1 Objectives:** ✅ Completed  
System deemed stable and ready to proceed to Day 2 (OS hardening phase).
