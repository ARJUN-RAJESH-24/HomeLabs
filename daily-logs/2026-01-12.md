## `daily-logs/2026-01-11.md` (Day 8)

### Day 8 — Storage Recovery & Backup Re-Architecture

**Focus:** Disk pressure recovery, Timeshift stabilization, HDD-first backup strategy

---

### Situation

* Root SSD (`/dev/sda3`) hit **100% usage** due to Timeshift rsync snapshots.
* Backup HDD (`/dev/sdb1`, 500GB) available but incorrectly used earlier.
* System remained bootable, SSH accessible, no data loss.

---

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Emergency Disk Recovery

* Identified root cause using:

  ```bash
  df -h
  sudo du -xh --max-depth=1 /
  ```
* Found `/backup` consuming ~81GB on root.
* Removed Timeshift data from root safely:

  ```bash
  sudo rm -rf /backup/*
  ```
* Result:

  * Root usage reduced from **100% → ~32%**
  * Inodes healthy

---

#### 2. Kernel & Boot Cleanup

* Removed unused Liquorix kernel artifacts:

  ```bash
  sudo apt autoremove
  ```
* Verified active kernel:

  ```bash
  uname -r
  ```

---

#### 3. Backup Disk Strategy

* Dedicated HDD (`/dev/sdb1`) confirmed healthy:

  ```bash
  sudo smartctl -H /dev/sda
  sudo smartctl -H /dev/sdb
  ```
* Mounted as primary data disk:

  ```bash
  /dev/sdb1 → /srv/data
  ```
* Backup directory standardized:

  ```bash
  /srv/data/backup
  ```

---

#### 4. Timeshift Stabilization

* Ensured no running jobs:

  ```bash
  ps aux | grep timeshift
  ```

* Verified Timeshift device detection:

  ```bash
  sudo timeshift --list-devices
  ```

* Confirmed config:

  ```bash
  sudo cat /etc/timeshift/timeshift.json | grep backup_device
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  backup_device_uuid = /dev/sdb1
  ```

* Created correct directory (no snapshot yet):

  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /srv/data/backup/timeshift
  ```

> No snapshot created today — intentional.

---

### Monitoring Installed & Verified

* Tools installed earlier confirmed operational:

  * `htop`
  * `iotop` (root only)
  * `iftop` (root only)
  * `sysstat / sar`
* Disk health validated via SMART.

---

### Known Issues (Deferred)

* `/backup` bind mount behavior is inconsistent due to systemd generator caching.
* Not blocking progress — postponed to later phase.
* Wi-Fi without internet causes routing oddities; mobile hotspot works reliably.

---

### Current State

* **Root SSD:** Stable, plenty of free space
* **Backup HDD:** Clean, mounted, ready
* **Timeshift:** Configured, idle, safe
* **System:** Bootable, SSH stable, no background disk churn

---

### Decision

* Proceed with **offline-first, HDD-only backups**
* Timeshift snapshots will be introduced **gradually** in next phase

---

### Next Day Plan (Day 9)

* Create **one controlled Timeshift snapshot**
* Define retention policy (daily/weekly)
* No networking or mount refactors

---

**Status:** 🟢 Recovered & Stable
**Data loss:** None

---

If you want, next I can:

* Add a **1-line summary** to `daily-logs/README.md`, or
* Prepare the **Day 9 checklist** before you execute anything.
