# 📅 Day 6 – Monitoring, Health Checks & Service Stability

**Date:** 2026-01-11
**Server:** ThinkPad Edge E530c (Linux Mint / Ubuntu Noble base)
**Client:** Acer Predator (Arch Linux)

---

## 🎯 Objectives for Day 6

* Establish **system observability**
* Verify **disk health**
* Formalize **daily health checks**
* Ensure **critical services survive reboot**
* Confirm system is **stable under idle**

---

## ✅ 1. Monitoring Tools Installed

Installed lightweight, terminal-based monitoring tools:

```bash
sudo apt install -y htop iotop iftop sysstat
sudo systemctl enable --now sysstat
```

### Tools Purpose

* **htop** → CPU & process monitoring
* **iotop** → Disk I/O visibility
* **iftop** → Network usage
* **sysstat (sar)** → Historical CPU stats

---

## 📊 2. CPU & System Load Verification

```bash
sar -u 1 3
```

**Result:**

* CPU idle consistently ~99%
* No abnormal system or IO wait
* Confirms excellent idle stability

---

## 💽 3. Disk Health (SMART)

### Primary SSD (`/dev/sda`)

* Health: **PASSED**
* Power-on hours: ~2261
* Reallocated sectors: **0**
* Temperature: ~40°C
* Wear indicators healthy

### Secondary HDD (`/dev/sdb`)

* Health: **PASSED**
* Power-on hours: ~15144
* No reallocated or pending sectors
* Temperature: ~30°C
* Previous short tests completed without error

Commands used:

```bash
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb
```

📌 **Conclusion:** Both disks healthy, no immediate risk.

---

## 📜 4. Log Inspection (Critical Errors Only)

```bash
journalctl -p 3 -xb
```

### Observed Errors (Expected / Non-Blocking)

* `nouveau` GPU errors (NVIDIA disabled later → expected)
* `thinkfan` service failure (not configured → safe)
* Bluetooth firmware warnings (non-critical)
* Keyboard init warnings during boot (harmless)

📌 **No errors affecting:**

* SSH
* Samba
* NFS
* Storage mounts
* Firewall

---

## 🔐 5. Service Enablement Check

Verified persistence across reboot:

```bash
systemctl is-enabled ssh smbd nfs-server ufw
```

**All services:** `enabled`

---

## 🔄 6. Service Status Verification

```bash
systemctl status ssh smbd nfs-server
mount | grep srv
```

### SSH

* Active
* Public-key authentication working
* Low memory footprint

### Samba (SMB)

* Active
* Serving `Family` share
* Accessible from LAN

### NFS

* Active
* `/srv/data` exported correctly
* Client mounts functional

---

## 🌐 7. Client Verification (Predator)

From Arch Linux client:

* SSH login successful
* NFS mount working
* CIFS mount working
* No authentication issues

---

## 🧠 Day 6 Assessment

### What’s Solid

* Observability in place
* Storage health confirmed
* Services resilient to reboot
* Logs understood (no blind panic)
* Server behaves like a **real server**

### Known Acceptable Noise

* Nouveau GPU errors
* thinkfan misconfiguration
* Bluetooth warnings

---

## ✅ Day 6 Status: **COMPLETE**

You now have:

* Visibility
* Predictability
* Confidence

This is the point where **homelabs stop being fragile experiments** and start behaving like infrastructure.
