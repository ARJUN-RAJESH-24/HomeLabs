### System: Lenovo ThinkPad E530c (Primary Server)

#### Hardware & Firmware
- Verified system stability under idle conditions
- Thermal paste was reapplied approximately one week prior; no thermal anomalies observed
- Performed thermal validation using CPU-X (fast run) and lm-sensors
- Confirmed Intel `coretemp` driver is active and reporting sane CPU temperatures
- Fan RPM not exposed (EC-controlled), expected behavior for ThinkPad laptops
- Discrete NVIDIA GPU disabled in BIOS to reduce power consumption and unnecessary thermal load
- Enabled Wake-on-LAN (WoL) in BIOS
- Enabled CPU virtualization (VT-x) in BIOS for future extensibility

#### Operating System
- Linux Mint currently installed (GUI retained temporarily for observability)
- Liquorix kernel identified as non-ideal for long-term server operation
- Decision made to migrate to a generic LTS / server-stable kernel in a later phase

#### Networking
- Verified Ethernet interface functionality
- Confirmed system obtains LAN IP correctly
- Basic network reachability tested

#### Services
- Installed OpenSSH server
- Enabled SSH to start automatically on boot
- Verified reliable SSH access from client machine

#### Notes / Decisions
- Display and desktop environment will be removed in the final hardening phase
- Power optimization steps initiated (GPU disabled, brightness minimization planned)
- System deemed stable and suitable to proceed to OS hardening (Day 2)
